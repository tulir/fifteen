# Project definition
The aim of the project is to implement an efficient way to solve
[15-puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

Based on preliminary research, it seems that [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
or some similar algorithm can be used along with some heuristics to solve
the problem.

The IDA* algorithm probably needs some tree or graph data structure.

The program will read and output text files with the game board columns
separated by spaces and rows separated by newlines.
