# Week 4 report
Didn't get much done due to being sick most of the week.

Split usage from readme to separate usage document and started working on
implementation and testing documents.

Added performance tests for some Puzzle functions used by the algorithm.
Reorganized code slightly, moved data structures and utility functions to own
packages. Also added comments and refactored some things.

Time spent: 4h
