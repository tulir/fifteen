# Week 3 report
Algorithm is now ~2x faster than last week thanks to reduced memory waste.

* Added more comments.
* Stopped using bytes.Buffer/string.Builder within algorithm.
* Simplified parts of algorithm.
* Reduced memory waste in IDA* by making and reversing moves instead of copying the puzzle struct.

Time spent: 6h
